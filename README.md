# **Welcome to the OMASE (Optimization, Modeling, Analysis and Space Exploration) Workshop page!!**

## Co-located with [CGO'19](http://cgo.org/cgo2019/)

## Purpose and Scope of OMASE

Current hardware and software trends are proving to be extremely complex and heterogeneous. This poses a serious challenge for developers and scientists when implementing their application code for a wide variety of architectures, network interconnects, deep memory hierarchies, accelerators, stacked run-time layers, among many other features.

This workshop aims to highlight research that automates the derivation of architecture-specific code, thus simplifying the porting, adaptation, and deployment process of applications. Such research encompasses techniques that systematically explore search spaces describing possible optimization strategies to derive the best target implementation. This includes architecture-specific transformations and optimization algorithms, performance and energy modeling, and automatic and hybrid exploration of the search spaces of strategies. 

We are interested in research that spans one or more performance factors such as the synergistic behavior of compile-time and runtime optimizations, application to architecture mapping, and the characterization of input-sensitive programs. The goal of the proposed workshop is to bring together academics, researchers, application scientists and programmers to share their preliminary research in all aspects of tuning and auto-tuning systems.

[OMASE Submission Link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=omase19)

OMASE will accept full papers (8 pages) and short/position papers (5 pages).
Please use version 1.54 or above of the following template to prepare your manuscript:

[Sigplan Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)

with 10pt font. Make sure to use the sigplan subformat. Visit the 
[SIGPLAN Author Resources page](http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/) 
for further information on SIGPLAN manuscript formatting.

Papers must be submitted in PDF format (readable by Adobe Acrobat
Reader 5.0 and higher) and formatted for 8.5" x 11" (U.S. Letter).

Papers should present original research and should provide sufficient
background material to make them accessible to the broader community. It
should not be submitted in parallel to any other conference or journal.

Acceptance of a paper commits at least one of the authors to register at
CGO'19 and present the work.
